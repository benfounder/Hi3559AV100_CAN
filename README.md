# Hi3559AV100_CAN
The CAN Bus driver for Hi3559AV100

Apply the patch to the root directory of kernel 4.9.37 and copy hi3559av100_can.c to "drivers/net/can/" directory. Then reconfigure the kernel to enable Hi3559AV100 CAN option, compile and run.

Hope you enjoy it.

Any problem let me know. Thank you!
